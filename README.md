Hi guys

After cloning the project, please use setup.sh to create the right folder. If the csv file is in the current directory, it will copy into the data folder. And this shell file will create the right structure for you.    
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
Run the basic_analysis and advanced, it should create some files in the output and data folder. 

The gragh.py will generate the graph of the dataset, the first function will create the a linear graph based on all the patient. The second sunction will generate one patient graph according to your choice.
